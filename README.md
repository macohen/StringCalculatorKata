# TDD Kata

We are working to integrate TDD into our engineering fiber.  I have a group of about 40 engineers around the world. Some
have embraced TDD in greenfield applications and are doing it for real! Others are dealing with legacy code and find it 
a bit more difficult to adapt to their every day lives.

With that, I decided it would be great to give everyone a way to practice. Following the martial arts training idea of 
Katas where you repeat the same lesson over and over until you have it down cold, we're doing the same at Viacom.  Everyone
on my team is spending 30 minutes each day in the next two weeks practicing a TDD Kata of their choice. I chose this one: http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/
by Roy Osherove. I'm working in Java using basic JUnit.
